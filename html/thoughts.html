                <h2>friends</h2>
                <h4>I love my friends they are always on my mind. <br> <br> what a luxury it is to love! Without limits,
                    rewards, expectations. That is why I am the wealthiest person alive with good friends by my side!
                    <br><br> My love for life has multiplied, ever since I got them back in my life. Do not take your
                    wealth for granted, because without it I was spiriling stranded. And though a true friend never
                    leaves you alone, it can get harder to see what you had in tow. <br> <br> Just to hear their voice
                    or feel their warmth what I wouldn't give! For the love of a friend you may rob me blind. I would
                    rather be poor and loved than rich and alone.
